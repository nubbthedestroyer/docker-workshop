# Application health checks

## Chapter Goal
1. Add HTTP health checks to the helloworld deployment
2. Simulate a failing deployment that fails a readiness probe
3. Simulate a failing deployment that fails a liveness probe

### Add HTTP health check to the helloworld deployment

We will take our existing hellworld deployment, and add a readiness and liveness probe healthchecks.
> Note: For kubernetes v1.16 and above `apps/v1beta1` has been deprecated, please use `apps/v1` instead
> Documentation for deprecated APIs in v1.16 [here](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/07/18/api-deprecations-in-1-16/)

```
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: helloworld-deployment
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: helloworld
  replicas: 1 # tells deployment to run 1 pods matching the template
  template: # create pods using pod definition in this template
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: helloworld
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: helloworld
        image: karthequian/helloworld:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

A readiness probe is used to know when a container is ready to start accepting traffic.

The yaml has the following parameters:
```
readinessProbe:
  # length of time to wait for a pod to initialize
  # after pod startup, before applying health checking
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  # Amount of time to wait before timing out
  initialDelaySeconds: 1
  # Probe for http
  httpGet:
    # Path to probe
    path: /
    # Port to probe
    port: 80
```

A liveness probe is used to know when a container might need to be restarted.

A liveness probe yaml has the following parameters that need to be filled out:

```
livenessProbe:
  # length of time to wait for a pod to initialize
  # after pod startup, before applying health checking
  initialDelaySeconds: 10
  # Amount of time to wait before timing out
  timeoutSeconds: 1
  # Probe for http
  httpGet:
    # Path to probe
    path: /
    # Port to probe
    port: 80
```

Thus, our deployment yaml now becomes:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: helloworld-deployment-with-probe
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: helloworld
  replicas: 1 # tells deployment to run 1 pods matching the template
  template: # create pods using pod definition in this template
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: helloworld
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: helloworld
        image: karthequian/helloworld:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        readinessProbe:
          # length of time to wait for a pod to initialize
          # after pod startup, before applying health checking
          initialDelaySeconds: 10
          # Amount of time to wait before timing out
          initialDelaySeconds: 1
          # Probe for http
          httpGet:
            # Path to probe
            path: /
            # Port to probe
            port: 80
        livenessProbe:
          # length of time to wait for a pod to initialize
          # after pod startup, before applying health checking
          initialDelaySeconds: 10
          # Amount of time to wait before timing out
          timeoutSeconds: 1
          # Probe for http
          httpGet:
            # Path to probe
            path: /
            # Port to probe
            port: 80

```

We run this yaml the same as we had done before: `kubectl create -f helloworld-with-probes.yaml`


### Simulate a failing deployment that fails a readiness probe
We will now try to simulate a bad helloworld pod that fails a readiness probe. Instead of checking port 80 like the last example, we will run a readiness check on port 90 to simulate a failing scenario. Thus, our yaml now is:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: helloworld-deployment-with-bad-readiness-probe
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: helloworld
  replicas: 1 # tells deployment to run 1 pods matching the template
  template: # create pods using pod definition in this template
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: helloworld
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: helloworld
        image: karthequian/helloworld:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        readinessProbe:
          # length of time to wait for a pod to initialize
          # after pod startup, before applying health checking
          initialDelaySeconds: 10
          # Amount of time to wait before timing out
          initialDelaySeconds: 1
          # Probe for http
          httpGet:
            # Path to probe
            path: /
            # Port to probe
            port: 90
```

We will run this yaml with the command `kubectl create -f helloworld-with-bad-readiness-probe.yaml`. After about a minute, we will notice that our pod is still not in a read state when we run the `kubectl get pods` command.

```
MacbookHome:04_02 Application health checks karthik$ kubectl get pods
NAME                                                              READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
helloworld-deployment-with-bad-readiness-probe-8664db7448-pv4fm   0/1       Running   0          1m
```

Describing the pod will show that the pod failed readiness:
```

### Simulate a failing deployment that fails a liveness probe

Next, we will simulate a bad helloworld pod that fails a liveness probe. Instead of checking port 80 like the last example, we will run a liveness check on port 90 to simulate a failing scenario. Thus, our yaml now is:

```
apiVersion: apps/v1beta1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: helloworld-deployment-with-bad-liveness-probe
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: helloworld
  replicas: 1 # tells deployment to run 1 pods matching the template
  template: # create pods using pod definition in this template
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: helloworld
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: helloworld
        image: karthequian/helloworld:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
        livenessProbe:
          # length of time to wait for a pod to initialize
          # after pod startup, before applying health checking
          initialDelaySeconds: 10
          # How often (in seconds) to perform the probe.
          periodSeconds: 5
          # Amount of time to wait before timing out
          timeoutSeconds: 1
          # Kubernetes will try failureThreshold times before giving up and restarting the Pod
          failureThreshold: 2
          # Probe for http
          httpGet:
            # Path to probe
            path: /
            # Port to probe
            port: 90
```


We will run this yaml with the command `kubectl create -f helloworld-with-bad-liveness-probe.yaml`. After about a minute, we will notice that our pod is still not in a read state when we run the `kubectl get pods` command.

```

```

When we describe our pod, we notice that it is failing the liveness probe:

```

```

And finally, when we check the deployment, we notice that deployment is not available as well.
```
MacbookHome:04_02 Application health checks karthik$ kubectl get deployments
NAME                                            DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE

```

To summarize, we've learned that we can use readiness and liveness probes to check the status of our pods and use them to restart pods when necessary and check pod health.
